# Java bindings for libwayland

This project aims to provide Java bindings to the Wayland backend library.
It does so by a combination of auto-generated Java code and appropriate JNI
bindings.  The main purpose of wayland-java is to service the Android
wayland server app that I am currently developing.

## Current state of the library

Right now, wayland-java is nowhere close to production code; it is in an
extremely developmental stage.  Very little is commented and it probably
has a plethora of bugs.  The primary purpose for this repository is to give
the greater wayland community a chance to look at my code.

## Building wayland-java

Building the library requires a slight modification to the wayland source
code.  I hope to submitting patches to the wayland project soon so that it
can be built unaltered.  However, for now libwayland requires a little
modification before it can be used. Also, the library is currently only set
up to build on the Android platform and requires the Android SDK and NDK to
build.

If you're brave enough to try and build wayland-java, you need to do the
following:

1. Install both the android SDK and NDK and get them configured
2. Clone git://github.com/jekstrand/wayland-java.git
3. Run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`
4. In the jni/external/wayland directory, you have to modify the wayland
source code to remove calls to `signalfd` and `timerfd` and their
respective header files
5. Use the Android tools to update the build paths to your version of the
Android SDK
6. Run ant
